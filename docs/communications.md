Hi Sunny. I am wondering about your services for doing an infographic on commercial thinning and moose. Let me know if you have time to do one of these with maybe a moose and a logging machine in it. I will send you the draft article too. This will be different perhaps because the infographic will be a figure in the article. Sound fun?

NOT SURE IF YOU KNOW ABOUT MOOSE OF NORTHERN BC ON INSTAGRAM BUT I POST ALL MY MOOSE SHOTS THERE AND YOU CAN ASK ME TO SEND ANY OF THOSE TO YOU IN LARGER FORMAT. FOR A LOGGING MACHINE, A HARVESTER/FORWARDER SYSTEM WOUKD BE BEST BECAUSE THEY CAN BE MORE DELICATE ;)

1. Rehabilitated roads after harvest to reduce access and increase food supply through reforestation 
2. Maintain visual screening along roads and trails to reduce sightlines for hunters/predators
3. Curve strips/openings to minimize sightlines, windthrow, snow drift and piling 
4. Ensure strips are wide enough for strong browse response
5. Ensure leave strips are wide enough to provide cover
6. Do not use herbicides
7. Cut in winter to leave slash and enhance deciduous browse resprouting
8. Retain all non-merch conifer and deciduous browseable species in harvest areas (both patches and single trees)
9. Leave dense patches of trees for screening/cover
