Hi Sunny. I am wondering about your services for doing an infographic on commercial thinning and moose. Let me know if you have time to do one of these with maybe a moose and a logging machine in it. I will send you the draft article too. This will be different perhaps because the infographic will be a figure in the article. Sound fun?

NOT SURE IF YOU KNOW ABOUT MOOSE OF NORTHERN BC ON INSTAGRAM BUT I POST ALL MY MOOSE SHOTS THERE AND YOU CAN ASK ME TO SEND ANY OF THOSE TO YOU IN LARGER FORMAT. FOR A LOGGING MACHINE, A HARVESTER/FORWARDER SYSTEM WOUKD BE BEST BECAUSE THEY CAN BE MORE DELICATE ;)
